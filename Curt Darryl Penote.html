    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>Hi! My name is Curt Darryl Sintos Penote, 18 years of age, from the City of Calbayog, Western Samar.</p> 
    <p>I am friendly, helpful, and genuine. I am also an extroverted person. I love travelling, especially in nature. I also fell in love with radio broadcasting. I have been an emcee for some events, such as weddings, school events, and church events. That's all for now! See you on the next page!</p>

    <h3>Why Did I Chose This Program/Course?</h3>
    <P>My family’s situation is rigid, and I know it would be challenging for us if I did proceed to college without any financial support, such as a scholarship. And since I was able to pass the entrance exam, interview, home visitation, and deliberation of Paserrelles Numériques, and since it was the biggest opportunity that came to me, I grabbed it. Although it is an opportunity, I am also interested in computers because I am curious. To sum up, I chose this program/course as it is a great opportunity for me and also to satisfy my curiosity by seeking answers through experience.</P>
